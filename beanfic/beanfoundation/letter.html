  <br/>
  <p>I should explain whats going on. Since the bomb dropped, we have been purifying beans poisoned by Jims and Co. We have been living on a stash of chickpeas, <br/>thats how we have survived so long. I know I've been gone for a while, but trust me. It is for the better.<br/></p>
  <p>Love you, Dallas</p>
