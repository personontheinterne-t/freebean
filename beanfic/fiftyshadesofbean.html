    <h1>Bean Story - Fifty shades of BEAN</h1>
  <p>/freebeans/beansfiction/50shbeans</p>
    <p>I walk into the legitimate business to be greeted by a hot and young and not at all sketchy kid who is probably underage. Why the hell am I calling a minimum wage Macdonalds employee<br/>hot? What the hell is wrong with me these days?. I walk into my office as the assistant managers. The same kid walks in and starts touching me. "WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL GET OFF ME YOU CREEP ABSOLUTE TRASHLING WhAT THE HELL"</p>
